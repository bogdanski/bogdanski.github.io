  <h1>War, Poverty and Misery: The Mis-Constructed Universe</h1>
  <h3>Felix Bogdanski, since 17.5.2020</h3>

  <p>Like some of Humanity, I spent a Lot of Time thinking about why there is so much Misery in the World.</p>

  <p>The simple Answer is found in the Construction of the Universe: Because God created it such that Races evolve, which need to digest Flesh of other sentient Beings to survive. These Races naturally have to become Hunters.</p>

  <p>And here is where all Problems start. When you eat an Apple, you don't kill the whole Tree. But when you eat Meat, full Death is implied. When Humanity shares Goods on a fair Basis, they don't kill each other. But when you put them under a Reptilian Money System, Debt and Death are implied, they start to kill each other, just to pay their Food. You see? This Universe is mis-constructed, because it allows for Hunters. Some may call it Free Will, but a Being is not free in the very Moment it takes Freedom from another by killing it &mdash; a Consequence of Quantum Physics and Density Functions. Thus, for a Free Will Being, it is physically impossible to kill.</p>

  <p>Because here we find Hunters, this Universe can not express Free Will. What you live through in this Universe is a pre-written Drama.</p>

  <p>In this Drama, Religions as Christianity or Buddhism address this Problem and try to solve it. For Instance, the Bible recommends to eat Plants and Seeds, and the Buddha would not harm a single Fly. And it works, for some Time, for some Planets. But as long as this Mis-Construction is physically possible, there will be Race Wars.</p>

  <p>If you truly want everlasting Peace, you better leave this Universe as it is. If you struggle, do not incarnate in it. There are other Universes, constructed by Loving Architects, and they give Free Will and Beauty in their Creation &mdash; without all the Misery.</p>

  <p>Why not create your own Universe? Remember, it is all just Thoughts.</p>
