  <h1>War, Poverty and Misery: The Ill-Constructed Universe</h1>
  <h3>Felix Bogdanski, since 17.5.2020</h3>

  <p>Like some of Humanity, I spent an awful Lot of Time thinking about why there is so much Misery in this World.</p>

  <p>The simple Answer is found in the Creator of this Universe. Because God created the Universe such that Races evolve, which need to digest the Flesh of sentient Beings to survive, these Races naturally have to become Hunters.</p>

  <p>And here is where all Problems start. When you eat an Apple, you don't kill the whole Tree. But when you eat Meat, Death is implied. When Humanity shares Goods on a fair Basis, they don't kill each other. But when you put them under a Reptilian Debt Slavery System, Death is implied, they start to kill each other, just to survive. You see? God ill-created this Universe on Purpose, because he allows for Hunters. Some may call it 'Free Will', but I don't think you are free when you take Freedom from others by killing them.</p>

  <p>Religions as Christianity or Buddhism address this Problem and try to solve it. For Instance, the Bible recommends to eat Plants and Seeds, and the Buddha would not harm a single Fly. And it works, for some Time, for some Planets. But as long as this Ill-Construction is physically possible, there will be Race Wars.</p>

  <p>If you truly want everlasting Peace, you better leave this Universe as it is and do not incarnate in it.</p>

  <p>There are other Universes, constructed by Loving Gods, and they too have Beauty in their Creation &ldash; without all the Misery.</p>

  <p>Why not create your own Universe? Remember, it is all just Thoughts.</p>
